//! twoten
//!
//! Hash data into two bytes, and turn it into an (exactly)
//! ten byte summary.
//!
//! Summaries are:
//!
//! * A 16-bit fnv1a hash of the data
//! * The first 8 bits of the hash are used to select a
//!     6-character word. See [`WORDS`].
//! * The next 8 bits of the hash are formatted in an octal format, `000` to `377`.
//!
//! The resulting summary looks like `JESTER-123`
